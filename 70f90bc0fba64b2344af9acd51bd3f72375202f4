      "message": "I was looking into why the roller was stuck and realized there\u0027s a small hiccup with the cq_over logic. If the roller truly isn\u0027t moving many commits forward, sometimes the branch never rolls, for over a month. This means it can get out of sync shortly after the last roll and then break the Skia autoroller for a long while.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to do it cleanly, but maybe we need to adjust whatever runs the autoroller script to forcefully do it once a week at minimum, so that we\u0027re not down for weeks on end.",
