There is already an I422Scale in webrtc\n2. adds public functions but does not have tests\nThe webrtc version is in webrtc:: name space, so as a work around, either check libyuv version, or add webrtc:: namespace to clarify which version.\n\nThe libyuv version can\u0027t be checked into all repos until the build error in webrtc is fixed",
