      "message": "note that scale_uv is not fully optimized for arm and intel and not at all for msa and mmi.\nthe code is based on argb and conceptually is a 2 channel version, while argb is 4 channels, but otherwise very similar.  so all functions that are in argb should eventually be in uv.\nscale_uv is for nv12 / nv21.  I would only bother optimizing if this format is used on lsx machines.\n\nrotate_argb is not efficient.  it will be refactored to be like planar rotation using 8x8 transpose, and then do a rotate_uv the same way.  work in progress.",
