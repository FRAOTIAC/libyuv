      "message": "We only pass -mfpu\u003dneon for the actual kernels themselves, so critically we don\u0027t pass this option for files like convert.cc that actually do the kernel lookup. Without the -D... we would build all the kernels but never actually use them anywhere since row.h when included from e.g. convert.cc would not define the HAS_..._NEON defines.\n\nThe alternative would be to pass -mfpu\u003dneon everywhere, but this seems like a bad idea if the intention is to treat Neon as an optional feature on 32-bit platforms since the compiler may choose to use it in normal C code without warning in that case?\n\nWhat do you think?",
