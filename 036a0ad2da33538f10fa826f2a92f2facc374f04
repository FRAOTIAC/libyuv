      "message": "unclear why planar argb would come up, but I assume you have a use case.  best to create a new bug for the planar support, as its not directly related to AR64.\nI would lean toward supporting the 2 bit alpha in AR30.\nI would lean toward simplifying these planar merge functions not doing shifts... assuming its a full 16 bits, or the msb of each uint16_t.\nThe AR30 conversion is going a bit beyond what \u0027planar\u0027 functions normally do... its really a conversion at that point.\nAR64 is integer and not a priority?  fp16 is the format we\u0027ll want for the RGB side?\nAs overlay formats, AR30 and P010 are supported overlay formats.\nAB4H is a common texture format.",
