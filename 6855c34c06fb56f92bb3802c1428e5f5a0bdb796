      "message": "Thanks for the CL!  Looks good overall.\nI\u0027d prefer less scaling references - ideally conversion would be independent of scaling code and vice versa.  But its not worth duplicating the code/headers.\n\u0027Linear\u0027 support is not important, but for I422 and I210 it makes sense.\n\nI\u0027ve had a request for more complete P010 support, so if you have a chance, include P010 with filtering",

      "message": "Linear is not really important, but it can be implemented using Bilinear, pointing the 2 rows to the same source.  So you could do this by passing a stride or the filter to Bilinear.\nBut also Linear is not used by anyone that I know, so it could be removed or left as an error.",
