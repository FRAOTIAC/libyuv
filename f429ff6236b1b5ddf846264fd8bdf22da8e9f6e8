      "message": "I\u0027m not very familiar with NEON, so I only implemented x86 SIMD.\n\nThe core logic can be ported to work on 10bit and 12bit easily, so I added them. But it\u0027s not suitable for 16bit. (Intermediate value can reach 16*maxValue, so 12bit is the limit)\n\nCurrently there\u0027s only row functions and API functions work on plane. Should we change the current I420ToARGB function or have another function like I420ToARGBBilinear?",

      "message": "These seem like they should be exposed publically a conversions, not scaling.\n\nConversions allow odd width destination, which you may want to handle via \u0027row_any\u0027 wrappers.\n\ne.g. I420ToI444 of an odd width image 639x480 should filter the UV similar to 640x480 but handle the last pixel with clamping.  One way to implement edge clamping is copy the row to a buffer and extrude the first and last pixel out, allowing the low level to process 2 pixels at a time.\n\nThe next level lower can be implemented as planar scaling, and ensure the low levels have specialized upsampling of 2x vertically and/or horizontally.\n\nLinear support is low priority - it can be implemented as Bilinear with a row stride of 0, and will still be a performance win.  I\u0027m tempted to remove linear row functions, but chroma upsampling is one usecase where it may still make sense.  I422ToI444 where the height is already full height, just needs horizontal upsample.\n\nAlso note there is uv_scale functions for NV12 scaling.  Many applications are moving toward NV12 instead of planar, and it has scaling performance advantages.\nWe\u0027ll need optimized filtering and 16 bit UV channels.\nUV scale is based on ARGB scale, and I anticipate RGB scale, and rotate for UV and RGB, with all row functions implemented in SIMD.\nThe API, both publically and low level row functions, needs to stay low to be feasible / maintainable / optimizable.
