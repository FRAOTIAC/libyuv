      "message": "Some notes:\nIn YUVToRGB functions all registers are already used, and generating constant for pmulhuw each time / place constant in memory is slower than psraw, so I didn\u0027t adopt pmulhuw in READYUV41X.\nI didn\u0027t add functions like I410AlphaToAR30, 2 bit alpha in AR30 is too inaccurate to be useful. We probably want something like I410AlphaToAR64, and then use FloatPlane to convert it into ARGBF16, which is used by GPU.\n",
