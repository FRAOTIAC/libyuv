      "message": "sort of right.  FULL TESTS are tests that are somewhat redundent or less useful... for example, functions that are only C and dont have SIMD, that users should be avoiding using.\n\nDISABLE_SLOW_TESTS is the real macro which in this case was support to make it fast enough.\nFASTSTEP could apply to all 3 loops, which may be enough to make it bearable",
