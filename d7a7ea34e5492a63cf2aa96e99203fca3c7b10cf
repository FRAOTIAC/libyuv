      "message": "matissa?  FYI  sobel is basically a 5 tap filter, much like gauss, but with different coefficients and offsets which sharpen edges.\nHistorically it was used in Google Hangouts video chat in a low bandwidth mode that reduced the video to just outlines.  It isnt used for that now and is likely not important, but sobel is a useful building block for filters, and the libyuv implementation is very fast, processing 16 bytes at a time using unaligned loads, compared to most implementations that do 8 byte aligned loads, processing half as much per iteration.",
