You can put this in a Clang-specific section, but we would really prefer that you continue building with Clang going forward (mostly so that any issues you encounter can be fixed ASAP, rather than when no other options are available).",

Given that we are going to use only clang going forward, i think it is ok to leave this on (unless you know of a way to pass this option only to clang).",
