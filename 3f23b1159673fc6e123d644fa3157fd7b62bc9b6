Its the equivalent to 2 pshufb.\nIf we put 8 Y and 8 UV into a register,  3 pshufb can produce 8 YUV24.\nI guess it works out, if the upper 8 Y and upper 8 UV, then 3 vpshufb produce 8 more YUV24 in the upper lanes, but its not arranged the way you want them.  3 lower parts for the first 8, and 3 upper parts for the next 8.",
