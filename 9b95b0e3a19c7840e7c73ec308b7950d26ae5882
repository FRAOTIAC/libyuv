      "message": "wont work.  this actually casts the float to int.\nWhat I want to do is grab the 32 bits of the float and extract 16 of them from the middle.\nA float normally has 1 bit sign, 8 bit exponent and 23 bit mantissa.\nA half float is 1 bit sign, 5 bit exponent and 10 bit mantinssa.\nAfter multiplying by the magic number 1.9259299444e-34f the 16 bits that represent the halffloat are the upper 10 bits of the mantissa, and the next 6 bits from the exponent.\nSo we shift by 13 to throw away 13 bits from the 23, leaving 10.  And keep the low 6 bits of the exponent.",
