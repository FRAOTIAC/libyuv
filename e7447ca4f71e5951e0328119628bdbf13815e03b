I have a script for applying clang tidy --fix so no worries.\nThe plan is to switch win32 builds to row_gcc.cc clangcl the same as win64.\nAnd then remove the visual c specific assembly, but perhaps keep intrinsics around for actual visual cl, as long as theres a way to test it.\nI\u0027m hoping windows arm builds can also do the same.\nFor now, keep it working until theres a good reason to break it.",
