      "message": "Note that this row_win.cc code only applies to actual Visual Studio compiler, and that particular function is for Win32.\nBecause Visual Studio hasn\u0027t supported 64 bit inline, I moved away from this file and use row_gcc.cc with clangcl to compile inline x86 code that is compatible with Visual C.  If you can, I suggest using clangcl, for ARM as well as X86.\nBut as long as row_win keeps working reasonably well, I\u0027ll keep the support there.  Thanks for the patch!",
