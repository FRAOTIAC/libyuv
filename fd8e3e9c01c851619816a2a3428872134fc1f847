      "message": "I often do several unrelated changes in google3 and upstream only when its important or requested for chromium.\nThese are important to upstream, but I think its fine to combine them at the upstreaming.  If one of them breaks, I would rollback the individual change in google3 and re-upstream.\nThe version doesnt need to roll each time.  Its more important when there is a public interface change.  But its good to do it for each CL in the master copy, which is google3.",
