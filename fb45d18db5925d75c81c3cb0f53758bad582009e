The very same script works perfectly for WebRTC (example: https://codereview.webrtc.org/2722223003) so I didn\u0027t check the actual diff for this DEPS. \nClearly there\u0027s some kind of bug that affects libyuv, so I filed https://bugs.chromium.org/p/libyuv/issues/detail?id\u003d690\n\nThanks for pointing this out.
